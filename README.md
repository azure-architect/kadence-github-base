# WordPress Client Development Template

A standardized, reusable development system for WordPress client projects. This template provides a consistent structure and workflow for managing multiple client websites.

## Features

- Standardized folder structure for WordPress development
- GitHub integration with workflow templates
- Local by Flywheel configuration for local development
- Automated deployment scripts
- Database synchronization between environments
- Configurable settings for easy client customization

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Local by Flywheel](https://localwp.com/) installed for local WordPress development
- Git and GitHub account
- SSH access to your hosting environment

### Creating a New Client Project

1. Click "Use this template" on GitHub to create a new repository
2. Clone the new repository to your local machine
3. Run the setup script with your client name:
```

./scripts/setup.sh client-name

```
4. Follow the prompts to configure the client-specific settings
5. Create a new site in Local by Flywheel
6. Copy your customized files to the Local by Flywheel site directory
7. Initialize Git in the Local by Flywheel site and connect to your client repository

### Configuration

Client-specific configuration files are stored in the `config/` directory.
Templates are provided for:

- Local development
- Staging environment
- Production environment

Edit these files with the appropriate database credentials and environment-specific settings.

## Deployment

Automated deployments are handled via GitHub Actions. The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.

To set up deployment for a client:

1. Add the client's SSH credentials as GitHub secrets in the repository
2. Configure the `CLIENT_HOST` and `CLIENT_PATH` variables
3. Push to the main branch to trigger a deployment

## Database Synchronization

Use the database sync script to pull or push database content between environments:

```

./scripts/db-sync.sh [pull|push] [environment]

```

Example: Pull database from production to local
```

./scripts/db-sync.sh pull production

```

## Folder Structure

```

wordpress-client-template/
├── .github/workflows/ # GitHub Actions workflows
├── wp-content/ # Custom WordPress content
│ ├── plugins/ # Custom or modified plugins
│ ├── themes/ # Custom themes
│ └── mu-plugins/ # Must-use plugins
├── scripts/ # Setup and deployment scripts
├── config/ # Environment configuration templates
├── .gitignore # Git exclusion rules
└── README.md # This documentation

```

## Customization

Each client project can be customized while maintaining the core structure and workflows. Common customization points:

- Theme configuration in `wp-content/themes/client-theme/`
- Adding client-specific plugins
- Environment-specific settings in config files
- Custom deployment rules in the GitHub workflow
